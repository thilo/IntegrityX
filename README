This was done during the DevHouseBerlin (http://wiki.upstream-berlin.com/index.php/DevHouseBerlin2).

I wrote this to play around with MacRuby (macruby.org) and Cocoa and provide this here for your entertainment.



== Requirements == 
It requires MacRuby 0.4 for OS X 10.5 or MacRuby 0.5 for OS X 10.6

== What it does ==
Allow you to choose one project from an Integrity (http://integrityapp.com) CI server for which you want to get updates of the build status

== Know Issues ==
* No error handling
* Lack of tests
* Might not work with future builds of MacRuby
* Pref changes are not picked up correctly

== TODO ==
* Do Testing
* Show colored menu item instead of text as status indicator
* Support display of multiple projects with status in the menu
* Hide unused menu
