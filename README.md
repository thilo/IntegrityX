# IntegrityX

TaskBar notifier for Integrity builds as an experiment for MacRuby

## Requirements

MacRuby 0.7 (trunk)   
Xcode

## Running Test

Part of the experiment :), simply by running the target Unit Test

### Test Setup

build these gems from source:

http://github.com/alloy/mocha-on-bacon (adapter for bacon)
http://github.com/alloy/mocha/tree/macruby (mocha with macruby fixes)
http://github.com/alloy/bacon (bacon - rspec like tests)

then installing these gems use:
  
    macgem install gemname --format-executable

this will give you a macbacon executable :)

Now you should be able to run the Unit Test Target

## TODOs

A Lot
